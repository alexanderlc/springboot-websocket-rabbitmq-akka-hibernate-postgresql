as follows , there are my faced with questions:
first question->  how to push a new branch to remote repository

you should create a new branch in local repository

like this  

git checkout -b develop

as a result, your local repository will add a new branch called at "develop"

and next you should create someting 

then add to staged directory

before last  commit

last but not least

git push -u origin develop



second question -> how to push local repository to specific remote repository

first  you should do like this:

in remote repository  ,you create a new repo ,named as you like

then in local repository  you should git init

then it will init a repository automatically

then git add .

will add all current directory all files recursively

then you should git commit -m "some thing"

you should add a remote repo call at "origin"

like this:

git remote add origin https://github.com/myyan/redis.git

at last 

git push -u origin master

next i will explain  -u  and origin means

-u is upstream   it will refer to the main repo that other people will be pulling from

e.g. your github repo

several minitus ago,

i add a remote repo

it called at origin

yeah this is our remote repo 

-u will automatically sets that upstream for you 

linking you repo to a central one.

that way , in the future , git knows where you want to push to  and where you want to pull from

so you can use got pull or git push without any arguments.
